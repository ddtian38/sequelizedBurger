# sequelizedBurger

This web application allows users to input a burger that they want to eat in the form below with the option to provide a link to the picture of the burger. After the data has been put into the database, the burger is added into the Uneaten section and the Burgers table. 

The user can type a name who can eat. After the name has been added to the Customer table, Sequelize will join the Burger and Customer table together to retrieve the information who ate the burger. The burger image moves to the eaten section with who has eaten the burger.
